I am a Ph.D. candidate and a researcher in quantitative marketing at Goethe University Frankfurt. In my research projects, I empirically analyze the impacts of privacy regulations focusing on the online advertising market. I explain and quantify the consequences for users (e.g., decision cost on cookie banners), firms (e.g., web traffic and tracking), and the whole market (e.g., network).
